# VideoWallSystem
A video wall solution for playing 8K resolution videos and images
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

This was a project I had to write very quickly. I was asked to remotely play 8K videos and images on a video wall from a single computer. At first, I tried several solutions like Media Player, but I encountered issues, especially with screen transitions and looping. I thought it would be easy, but I ended up dealing with frustrating problems.

Later, I decided to go with VLC. The best option would have been to write my own player, but I had very little time, and this solution met the requirements. This product was the result. It is actively being used. Since it served its purpose, I didn't continue developing it further, and I haven't even done any code cleanup or improvementsâ€”sorry about that! There might even be some unused code left inside.

If you want to continue, I'm sharing all the code for both the client and server.
